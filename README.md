## Date and Place
This is an eight week course on Monday from 6:00 PM - 8:00PM and the exact dates and place of the next course will be announced later. Stay tuned!

## Description
**This course is based on Naomi Ceder’s book, "[The Quick Python Book 3rd Edition by Naomi Ceder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617294039/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0)".**

Why Python? Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively [[python.org](https://www.python.org/)]. Python is a powerful, expressive programming language that’s easy to learn and fun to use!

Created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991, Python has been utilized by every major company such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple, NASA, Dropbox, Uber, etc. and in many places. You can read the long list of [Python Success Stories](https://www.python.org/about/success/) from python.org website.

## Prerequisite
This course "assumes you already have experience in one or more programming languages. Although some basic concepts are covered, there’s no attempt to teach fundamental programming skills in this course, and the basic concepts of flow control, OOP, file access, exception handling, and the like are assumed." (['The Quick Python Book 3rd Edition by Naomi Ceder'](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617294039/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0))

## Requirements
You need a Windows 10, Mac OSX, or Linux computer (optional charger) with at least 4GB (8GB+ is reommended) of memory and be able to install program and follow instruction to do works.
